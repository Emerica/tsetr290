Finally sick of not having a good ETR290 reporter on linux that doesnt cost a fortune.
I'm not a educated programmer so any improvments or wtf's feel free to let me know or make it better yourself.
Some code blatanley ripped from tstools from zhoucheng and opencaster.
Python GUI for this will be made in another repo.
